== Features

Opencsv supports all the basic CSV-type things you're likely to want to do:

   * Arbitrary numbers of values per line.
   * Ignoring commas in quoted elements.
   * Handling quoted entries with embedded carriage returns (i.e. entries that span multiple lines).
   * Configurable separator and quote characters (or use sensible defaults).

All of these things can be done reading and writing, using a manifest of malleable methodologies:

   * To and from an array of strings.
   * To and from annotated beans.
   * From a database
   * Read all the entries at once, or use an Iterator-style model
